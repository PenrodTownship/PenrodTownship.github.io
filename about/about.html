        <p class="first-graf"><span>Sports journalism was my first obsession.</span> A childhood fascination with daily newspapers and sports magazines led me to chase a career in storytelling. In high school, I dove deep into sports writing. In college, I pursued it aggressively, taking on every reporting assignment I could get from South Carolina’s largest papers.</p>

        <p>By graduation, the market for sports journalists had become flooded. Yet there was a deep need for journalists who could design pages. After nearly a year of searching for work, a college advisor pointed me to a small paper in search of a news designer. I was hired, and the next several years unfolded quickly.</p>

        <p>In three months, I advanced to a larger in-state paper. In another nine months, South Carolina’s largest daily, The State, reached out in need of a sports designer. It was a perfect match. I knew its sports section inside-out, and had held a number of part-time jobs in its newsroom while in college.</p>

        <p>After some time at The State, I had a clear-eyed realization. While writing about sports was what drew me to journalism, I began to see other opportunities to reach a broader audience. Writing was just one way to tell a story. Design offered a large toolset that could be used to make storytelling more resonant. As a reporter, I could write one or two stories a day. As a designer, I could elevate several. Or, even better, I could use design to improve the entire reading experience.</p>

        <p class="first-graf"><span>Design became my new obsession.</span> Over the next decade, it would carry me around the country to tell stories alongside some of journalism’s best design minds at The San Diego Union-Tribune, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and at Joe Zeff Design, a creative studio in New Jersey. The sum of those roles carried me to Minneapolis, where I now lead teams of story and product designers for the Star Tribune.</p>

        <p>Along the way, I learned how to tell all kinds of individual stories. I adopted design-thinking practices to deeply engage audiences on screens and in print. I became an adherent of using deep research, iterative prototyping and user-testing to solve problems. I started to code to improve reader experiences. And I helped create shared systems and processes to scale design operations. </p>

        <p>I believe in the power of analytical thinking to guide decision-making. But, more than that, I know — and feel deep down in my bones — that good design fuels good businesses. </p>
