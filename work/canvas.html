      <h1>Canvas</h1>
      <p id="project-meta">Desktop web app  •  2018</p>
      <p id="summary-description">Makers and project managers are passionate about the products they create. But the road to get there is a grind. Without the right tools, that process is a nightmare.</p>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>UX Researcher   •   Content Strategist   •   Product Designer   •   Identity Designer   •   Visual Designer</p>
    </section>


    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p id="overview-summary">Canvas is a full-featured toolset that helps creative teams go from brainstorm to action plan to market-ready deliverable. Now, teams can focus on the craft, not the stress.</p>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Most creative teams use seperate cloud storage and organization tools to brainstorm, iterate, collaborate, strategize and plan. But makers are missing a platform that puts all those needs under one roof, and lack a toolkit that makes moving between each stage easy while keeping a premium on focus and creativity.</p>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Canvas helps teams go from sketch to reality with tools that make managing, sharing and collaborating on projects a near-effortless process. Canvas applies structure to ideas, and helps turn goals into a cohesive vision. To help makers finish on time and on target, Canvas offers roadmap tools, punch lists and user tagging.</p>

    <!-- PROJECT DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH -->
    <section id="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery and research</h2>
      <p class="section-summary" id="discovery-summary">Cloud storage and organization suites often fail to meet core needs for creative teams. Through user research, I identified missing features that could set a new platform apart.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-discovery.svg" alt="Discovery lede image">

      <h3>Competitve analysis</h3>
      <p>To better understand the current cloud storage and organization marketplace, I focused on three products — <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvllEbMGjkxMX8X3_hKByN3StUAWCWDM3P4tJ-eMkcI/edit#bookmark=id.dsmca9ocl43q" target="_blank">Milanote</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvllEbMGjkxMX8X3_hKByN3StUAWCWDM3P4tJ-eMkcI/edit#bookmark=id.qjo7e2789ipd" target="_blank">InVision Boards</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvllEbMGjkxMX8X3_hKByN3StUAWCWDM3P4tJ-eMkcI/edit#bookmark=id.trawo7hiuctl" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> — that have medium-to-high use among creatives. I identified each company’s core brand message, and analyzed their respective strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. In the end, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvllEbMGjkxMX8X3_hKByN3StUAWCWDM3P4tJ-eMkcI/edit#bookmark=id.fbvfbxhsjyah" target="_blank">I hypothesized</a> that opportunities exist in a tool that helps makers organize ideas in a visual way (like Pinterest and InVision Boards) inside of a free-form moodboard environment (like Milanote) with a productivity overlay (like <a href="https://www.twotumbleweeds.co/hatch/" target="_blank">Hatch journals</a>) all while keeping centralized digital storage at its core.</p>

      <h3>User research</h3>
      <p>To determine what products and features makers use most, I created a <a href="http://bit.ly/penrod-online-tools-survey" target="_blank">user survey</a> focused on creatives and creative team managers. Some key findings:</p>

      <p class="user-research-label">Cloud-storage use and file-sharing tools</p>
      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-research-tools-1.png" alt="Google Drive and Dropbox results">

      <p class="user-research-label">Project management or collaboration tools</p>
      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-research-tools-2.png" alt="Slack and Google Docs results">



      <h3>User personas</h3>
      <p>The spectrum of human needs seemed to gravitate toward three core user types, which I used to create user personas who represent Canvas’ target audience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HEpY0Hg-N3_fA8TsWjo3pL-ffX8RFT4d" target="_blank">Bobby T</a>, a designer, works on larger teams to develop high-impact experiences. Cloud-based editing is important, as is a tool that allows for free-form associations and drawing/creating annotations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DiYQCDZrpbMBvKqCDMy9JuLL2wM3JfRH" target="_blank">Chin W</a>, a product manager, works daily with creatives and manages goals, assets and milestones. She has a strong desire for seamless collaboration and efficiency.</p>
      <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cdnshhUxX1J9LTdit4c3iNlccvuE479E" target="_blank">Jean G</a>, a freelance artist, wants plenty of canvas to think, needs a tool to scope work and would prefer to use the same tool to share work with clients for feedback.</p>

    <!-- PROJECT INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section id="info-arch">
      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <p class="section-summary" id="info-arch-summary">Flexible, dynamic moodboards could help bring teams together under a shared vision. Turning that idea into a market-changing product requires several key user features.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-user-stories.png" alt="User stories spreadsheet image">

      <h3>User stories and flows</h3>
      <p>To inform a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1niULd2yvOtt-xP5XCko9m-ur2x9gVKxG_LBeVFX12Fk/edit#gid=100351286" target="_blank">“global” feature set</a>, I created user stories to cover the overlap between all three user personas (designer, project manager, maker). These user stories provided a blueprint to create user flows that addressed these major user needs:</p>

      <ul id="canvas-user-flows">
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D49wyHnVe9zFzevTSufMbvhqeABRSDNk" target="_blank">Flow 1</a>: Access moodboards</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X6uKyCL2lTYmkVrb-i-Ck9lYp9Wx5okn" target="_blank">Flow 2</a>: Create account / log in</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=14j7qS9QeGUPeb9ZlSWryOkaXLbP_MNjE" target="_blank">Flow 3</a>: Add to moodboard</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VHezX-YIZhJJQK7MLp3tlhNHARaCJtT4" target="_blank">Flow 4</a>: Edit moodboard</li>
        <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DPZy1PGAkbJu0_CMYcTT8-BAY8yvPJYw" target="_blank">Flow 5</a>: Connect/share moodboard</li>
      </ul>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-user-flow.png" alt="User flow edit example">

      <h3>Content strategy and wireframes</h3>
      <p>I built a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gfvxD1R9rNcpSrfHLCtgxq4TrxfGcCRb" target="_blank">site map</a> to inform initial wireframes for a dynamic moodboarding tool as well as a product marketing site, and created a spreadsheet-based <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J1POiQcB20Yn5-tTEVUEZaWbOCzx_ZKPveiIUvsVMMk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">content strategy</a> to map out the site’s core features. These tools helped me keep an eye on the big picture as I sketched out eight key pages: landing page, pricing, sign in, sign up, project dashboard, community dashboard and moodboard editor. With sketches in place, I turned to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Al9Tooj5_VFqFNm6dyntvLozyC5GQ5i6" target="_blank">low-fidelity wireframes</a> to apply more precision to site content.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-wireframes.png" alt="Wireframe example">

      <h3>Lo-fi prototype  and user testing</h3>
      <p>With site wireframes in hand, I created a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1U72wz7HJXCp-LBW8AoS-Ua9ONpSMGkUx" target="_blank">simple and clickable prototype</a> to gain initial feedback and to test assumptions. I created a <a href="http://bit.ly/bloc-penrod-ck11-usability-testscript" target="_blank">testing script</a> and found three willing users to try to break it. </p>
      <p>Early results were promising. In general, testers understood how to navigate pages. They were easily able to articulate the site’s purpose as well as a core understanding of how they might use this product. One trouble spot — a pair of onboarding screens — surfaced in testing, and it became clear that I needed to rethink some basic language and prompts on those screens.</p>

    <!-- PROJECT VISUAL DESIGN -->
    <section id="visual-design">
      <h2>Visual Design</h2>
      <p class="section-summary" id="visual-design-summary">Brand vision and product intention proved to be key in guiding unique and high-impact design decisions. Mind maps and key questions led to a holistic look and feel.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-viz-design.png" alt="Visual design example images">

      <h3>Branding: Discovery</h3>
      <p>With core wireframes modeled and early user testing complete, I switched gears to make some key product design decisions — high-impact visual details (typography, color, iconography, brand logo) and marketing direction (product name, brand mission and taglines).</p>
      <p>I listed out key <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKHjPETsBOzGmwt9Idt9DNGA5CxjA-OCm4kZ1yG6rBE/edit#bookmark=id.u634lpni2xir" target="_blank">brand details</a>, created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKHjPETsBOzGmwt9Idt9DNGA5CxjA-OCm4kZ1yG6rBE/edit#bookmark=id.bqr6mob0gxkf" target="_blank">mind-map</a>, addressed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKHjPETsBOzGmwt9Idt9DNGA5CxjA-OCm4kZ1yG6rBE/edit#bookmark=id.2y7iksi37uc6" target="_blank">key questions</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKHjPETsBOzGmwt9Idt9DNGA5CxjA-OCm4kZ1yG6rBE/edit#bookmark=id.ujxpchqes49r" target="_blank">revisited companies</a> from my competitive analysis to document their signature design choices. I put together a brand-design <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/WX3NW9EYQGT/" target="_blank">moodboard</a> to work through inspirations in color, iconography, logo typography and site typography.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-swatches.png" alt="Canvas swatches">

      <h3>Finding a name</h3>
      <p>In order to name this platform, I thought back to user research when an opportunity for a product-defining feature first emerged. This new tool would need to provide a large and seemingly infinite canvas to allow makers to attach as much thinking — annotations, imagery, links and multimedia — to working ideas as possible. They would need to funnel these ideas toward actions, timelines and to-do lists to move toward deliverables, and they could use plenty of open space to do so. After trying several ideas, I decided “Canvas” best captured all of those essential qualities. </p>

      <h3>Refinement</h3>
      <p>Having a brand name allowed me to move into logo exploration. I started by sketching several “C”s from “Canvas”, envisioning these “C”s as a possible logomark. One set of “C”s trended towards capturing the moodboard-like aspect of Canvas. Another set leaned into the overlap of ideas that come from ideation. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QGiysKBSVavAyiwcB_mSAHWJC1ISGlor/view" target="_blank">Initial sketches</a> led to more <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7xCifn6B7DmRVhKOFUwUHQ3X1ZYaFZ4bWQ2Z2pIQk0yX0Zv/view" target="_blank">refined sketches</a>. I sought brand typeface options (<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/rbno2-1/a-medium/" target="_blank">RBNo2.1 b Medium</a> and <a href="https://www.losttype.com/font/?name=outage" target="_blank">Outage</a>) that had power and high contrast to get to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pVnpjb20VH01FyPBzOtAkCNbBNe698iM" target="_blank">working render</a>. I also started to explore site typography (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito" target="_blank">Nunito</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora" target="_blank">Lora</a>), and created a working style guide to pull all of the brand's design and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I85GNgyf1aEc1p5vUiobSgaUIG-lcKqP">style guidelines together.</a> </p>

    <!-- PROJECT PROTOTYPE -->
    <section id="prototype">
      <h2>Prototype and Testing</h2>
      <p class="section-summary" id="prototype-summary">Once rubber met road, the real fine-tuning began. Applying earlier designs to wireframes exposed new weaknesses and user testing help surface potholes.</p>

      <img src="../images/canvas/canvas-user-test.png" alt="Canvas user testing samples">

      <h3>Hi-fidelity prototypes</h3>
      <p>With key design decisions roughed in, I revisited wireframes to add polish and apply these decisions. And then a not-so-surprising thing happened — a few design weaknesses were exposed. In the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lwCuQ-gJNJZe2ypK3ee-6GVnFEk2balh" target="_blank">original logomark</a>, multiple stroke weights led to a visual imbalance. So I adjusted to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vb05Yw9QcWh9AKW99j7682Ykow4RzUkJ" target="_blank">single weight</a>. I also discovered the mono-stroked logomark did not read well at small sizes. So I created a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lnLmfcukV2TF7UmjfNkB-DoVcpLcuqWr" target="_blank">small-logomark alternate</a> with a solid fill color instead of an outline. I also polished a few initial color choices, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xMFOYj8vpuaPEUV6j_g1R-Hcf6utYqKB" target="_blank">updated the style guide</a>. When I was finished, I had a full set of <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ojTS5Htz1BJVCijYo_GjLgjRUf4POUrb" target="_blank" >hi-fidelity prototypes</a> for desktop as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYEn6d2YdEQ-MoxmKOJU2yTn0bJ9U6W0" target="_blank">mobile prototypes</a> with corresponding screens. I even created a preference test for a few of the screens, including two for desktop (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w8xYPH2JN1lQwTUDHGjZLyoTCyBDjISU" target="_blank">1</a> & <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zGM7hCOepsY_qIAinqGub3WUuk4voo1j" target="_blank">2</a>) and one for <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MADHOmG8bKxu4nQIS5mWxwLkS9IdS0nN" target="_blank">mobile</a>.</p>

      <h3>User testing</h3>
      <p>With hi-fidelity desktop and mobile designs ready, I turned the desktop designs into a <a href="https://invis.io/6SNJFCFN4BW#/314547383_Landing_Page" target="_blank">clickable prototype</a> to be tested, and created <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10HItGdpht6VEkclCfiBESqs3S9zbnwzJoP-1xVL95eI" target="_blank">another testing script</a>. I chose a tester from the wireframe testing group as well as two new testers. Once again, testing yielded overall positive results. But, more importantly, it also exposed opportunities for more tightening:</p>

      <ul id="canvas-user-tests">
        <li>Adding a sticky nav to the landing page would keep core site options top-of-mind</li>
        <li>Overhauling a tutorial prompt — from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nVt0C7IwdYYl2TTgkyoGRaTTkv4nhBO9" target="_blank">this</a> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rAQz4kN1bhOjQ8RbsUnIH4xxkbmPEXS-" target="_blank">this</a> — could reduce cognitive load</li>
        <li>Adding a cursor tooltip on the board creation example screen could lower confusion</li>
        <li>Renaming/reordering sort options on the dashboard screen could lower confusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After testing, I worked up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxlSSKeC4Og50iwESzf60xEtwK0FOaDbiA5WKJBJc4Y/edit#bookmark=id.fpy6jdjq7wxn" target="_blank">full summary</a> and went to work addressing these issues.</p>

    <!-- PROJECT CONCLUSION -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="section-summary" id="conclusion-summary"><span>I’m proud of the rigor I poured into Canvas,</span>and the resulting work. Full-featured, market-ready products are rarely produced by a single person. However, this months-long process helped me better understand just how critical each step is in developing a successful product. I gained a new and deep appreciation for the immediate insights that come from rounds of user testing. This project taught me that a methodical, well-worn process can lead to well-designed products that provide high value for users.</p>
