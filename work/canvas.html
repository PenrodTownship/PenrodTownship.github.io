          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p id="overview-summary">Canvas is a full-featured toolset that helps creative teams go from brainstorm to action plan to market-ready deliverable. Now, teams can focus on the craft, not the stress.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-subcontent">
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>Most creative teams use seperate cloud storage and organization tools to brainstorm, iterate, collaborate, strategize and plan. But makers are missing a platform that puts all those needs under one roof, and lack a toolkit that makes moving between each stage easy while keeping a premium on focus and creativity.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Canvas helps teams go from sketch to reality with tools that make managing, sharing and collaborating on projects a near-effortless process. Canvas applies structure to ideas, and helps turn goals into a cohesive vision. To help makers finish on time and on target, Canvas offers roadmap tools, punch lists and user tagging.</p>

          <h3>Competitve analysis</h3>
          <p class="non-grouped">To better understand the current cloud storage and organization marketplace, we focused on <a href="http://bit.ly/bloc-penrod-ck5-2-comp-analysis-submission" target="_blank">three products</a> — Milanote, InVision Boards and Pinterest — that have medium-to-high use among creatives. We identified each company’s core brand message, and analyzed their respective strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. In the end, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvllEbMGjkxMX8X3_hKByN3StUAWCWDM3P4tJ-eMkcI/edit#bookmark=id.fbvfbxhsjyah" target="_blank">we hypothesized</a> that opportunities exist in a tool that helps makers organize ideas in a visual way (like Pinterest and InVision Boards) inside of a free-form moodboard environment (like Milanote) with a productivity overlay (like Hatch journals) all while keeping centralized digital storage at its core.</p>

          <h3>User research</h3>
          <div class="category-grouped">
            <p>To determine what products and features makers use most, we created a <a href="http://bit.ly/penrod-online-tools-survey" target="_blank">user survey</a> focused on creatives and creative team managers. Some key findings:</p>

These tools helped me keep an eye on the big picture as we sketched out eight key pages: landing page, pricing, sign in, sign up, project dashboard, community dashboard and moodboard editor. With sketches in place, we turned to  low-fidelity <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Al9Tooj5_VFqFNm6dyntvLozyC5GQ5i6" target="_blank">wireframes</a> to apply more precision to site content.</p>

We created a <a href="http://bit.ly/bloc-penrod-ck11-usability-testscript" target="_blank">testing script</a> and found three willing users to try to break it. </p>
            <p>Early results were promising. In general, testers understood how to navigate pages. They were easily able to articulate the site’s purpose as well as a core understanding of how they might use this product. One trouble spot — a pair of onboarding screens — surfaced in testing, and it became clear that we needed to rethink some basic language and prompts on those screens.</p>

          <h3>Finding a name</h3>
          <p class="non-grouped">In order to name this platform, we thought back to user research when an opportunity for a product-defining feature first emerged. This new tool would need to provide a large and seemingly infinite canvas to allow makers to attach as much thinking — annotations, imagery, links and multimedia — to working ideas as possible. They would need to funnel these ideas toward actions, timelines and to-do lists to move toward deliverables, and they could use plenty of open space to do so. After trying several ideas, we decided “Canvas” best captured all of those essential qualities. </p>

          <h3>Refinement</h3>
          <p class="non-grouped">Having a brand name allowed me to move into logo exploration. We started by sketching several “C”s from “Canvas”, envisioning these “C”s as a possible logomark. One set of “C”s trended towards capturing the moodboard-like aspect of Canvas. Another set leaned into the overlap of ideas that come from ideation. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QGiysKBSVavAyiwcB_mSAHWJC1ISGlor/view" target="_blank">Initial sketches</a> led to more <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7xCifn6B7DmRVhKOFUwUHQ3X1ZYaFZ4bWQ2Z2pIQk0yX0Zv/view" target="_blank">refined sketches</a>. We sought brand typeface options (RBNo2.1 b Medium and Outage) that had power and high contrast to get to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pVnpjb20VH01FyPBzOtAkCNbBNe698iM" target="_blank">working render</a>. We also started to explore site typography (Nunito and Lora), and created a working style guide to pull all of the brand's design and style guidelines <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I85GNgyf1aEc1p5vUiobSgaUIG-lcKqP">together.</a></p>

          <h3>Hi-fidelity prototypes</h3>
          <p class="non-grouped">With key design decisions roughed in, we revisited wireframes to add polish and apply these decisions. And then a not-so-surprising thing happened — a few design weaknesses were exposed. In the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lwCuQ-gJNJZe2ypK3ee-6GVnFEk2balh" target="_blank">original logomark</a>, multiple stroke weights led to a visual imbalance. So we adjusted to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Vb05Yw9QcWh9AKW99j7682Ykow4RzUkJ" target="_blank">single weight</a>. We also discovered the mono-stroked logomark did not read well at small sizes. So we created a small-logomark <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lnLmfcukV2TF7UmjfNkB-DoVcpLcuqWr" target="_blank">alternate</a> with a solid fill color instead of an outline. We also polished a few initial color choices, and updated the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xMFOYj8vpuaPEUV6j_g1R-Hcf6utYqKB" target="_blank">style guide</a>. When we were finished, we had a full set of hi-fidelity prototypes for <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ojTS5Htz1BJVCijYo_GjLgjRUf4POUrb" target="_blank" >desktop</a> as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYEn6d2YdEQ-MoxmKOJU2yTn0bJ9U6W0" target="_blank">mobile</a> prototypes with corresponding screens. We even created a preference test for a few of the screens, including two for desktop (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w8xYPH2JN1lQwTUDHGjZLyoTCyBDjISU" target="_blank">1</a> & <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zGM7hCOepsY_qIAinqGub3WUuk4voo1j" target="_blank">2</a>) and one for <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MADHOmG8bKxu4nQIS5mWxwLkS9IdS0nN" target="_blank">mobile</a>.</p>

          <h3>User testing</h3>
          <div class="category-grouped">
            <p>With hi-fidelity desktop and mobile designs ready, we turned the desktop designs into a <a href="https://invis.io/6SNJFCFN4BW#/314547383_Landing_Page" target="_blank">clickable prototype</a> to be tested, and created another testing script. We chose a tester from the wireframe testing group as well as two new testers. Once again, testing yielded overall positive results. But, more importantly, it also exposed opportunities for more tightening:</p>
            <ul id="canvas-user-tests">
              <li><span>•</span> Adding a sticky nav to the landing page would keep core site options top-of-mind</li>
              <li><span>•</span> Overhauling a tutorial prompt — from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nVt0C7IwdYYl2TTgkyoGRaTTkv4nhBO9" target="_blank">this</a> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rAQz4kN1bhOjQ8RbsUnIH4xxkbmPEXS-" target="_blank">this</a> — could reduce cognitive load</li>
              <li><span>•</span> Adding a cursor tooltip on the board creation example screen could lower confusion</li>
              <li><span>•</span> Renaming/reordering sort options on the dashboard screen could lower confusion</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After testing, we worked up a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxlSSKeC4Og50iwESzf60xEtwK0FOaDbiA5WKJBJc4Y/edit#bookmark=id.fpy6jdjq7wxn" target="_blank">full summary</a> and went to work addressing these issues.</p>

Full-featured, market-ready products are rarely produced by a single person. However, this months-long process helped me better understand just how critical each step is in developing a successful product. I gained a new and deep appreciation for the immediate insights that come from rounds of user testing. This project taught me that a methodical, well-worn process can lead to well-designed products that provide high value for users.</p>
